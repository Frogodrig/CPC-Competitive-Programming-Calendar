# Detailed Description
- This app uses the [CLIST API](https://www.clist.by).
- The app shows upcoming contests hosted by [CodeChef](https://www.codechef.com) and [Codeforces](https://www.codeforces.com) on the initial run as they're fairly popular. 
- You can filter contests by the website/platform.
- Contests can also be filtered by time by clicking the TODAY button. (Toggling between today/upcoming contests).
- The filters (website/ platform) applied are saved in the local storage of the browser.
- The "Upcoming" filter (by toggling the TODAY button), when applied, displays contests that start after your current time.
- The "Today" filter (by toggling the TODAY button), when applied, displays contests that started in the then current month (max 31 days back) and before the next day.
- Clicking on any contest card will redirect you to the respective contest page.
